description: "Implementing behavior intervention plans with fidelity. Experienced in data collection, pairing, and supporting clinical supervisors."
aboutMe: "I am an aspiring Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) with research training and operational discipline. Before clinical work, I developed systematic approaches to data management and protocol adherence through high-volume operations. I apply this same rigor to behavioral research—I don't just follow procedures, I understand the systems that make them effective. My goal is to combine research methodology with applied behavioral practice."
