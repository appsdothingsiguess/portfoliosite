methodology: "Utilized a 2x2 factorial design with 75 participants. Participants engaged in a computerized task (programmed in E-Prime) mimicking slot-machine logic. Reaction times and persistence (number of trials) were logged."
findings:
  - "Variable Ratio (VR) schedules showed 40% higher persistence than Fixed Ratio (FR)."
  - "Significant interaction found between reward magnitude and frequency (p < .05)."
