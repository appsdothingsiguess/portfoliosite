summary: "Investigated social media attentional bias and gratitude using a modified Stroop task with 68 participants. Found significant negative correlation (r = -0.278, p < .05) and presented at WPA 2025."
methodology: "Co-designed and executed psychological research study investigating the relationship between social media attentional bias, gratitude, contentment (PEACE), and fear of missing out (FOMO) using a modified Stroop task. Recruited and coordinated 68 undergraduate participants, administering computerized experimental protocols and multiple validated questionnaires (GQ-6, PEACE Scale, FOMO Scale) via Qualtrics. Conducted statistical correlation analysis revealing significant negative correlation between gratitude and attentional bias (r = -0.278, p < .05). Presented findings at the 2025 Western Psychological Association Conference."
