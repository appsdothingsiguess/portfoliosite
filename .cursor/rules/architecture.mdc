description: architecture of the website
alwaysApply: false
---
This project is a **static, employer-facing personal website** designed to showcase:
- Journalism work (clips, awards)
- Psychology research (WPA, methods, tools)
- Leadership & operations (Business Manager, Spezz LLC)
- Resume & contact information

The architecture prioritizes:
- Credibility
- Accessibility
- Fast load times
- Maintainability
- Clear information hierarchy for recruiters

This is **not** an application platform, marketplace, or CMS.

## High-Level Architecture

**Type:** Static site  
**Rendering:** Static (no server-side rendering required)  
**Primary stack:**  
- Astro (content-driven static framework)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (mapped to CSS design tokens)
- Markdown / MDX content collections

**No backend. No authentication. No client-side state beyond UI.**

---

## Architectural Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Content over interactivity**
   - Employers skim.
   - Avoid unnecessary JavaScript.
   - Default to HTML + CSS.

2. **Proof > Claims**
   - Every major claim must be supported by:
     - A clip
     - A PDF
     - A photo
     - A statistic with context

3. **Accessibility is structural, not decorative**
   - Semantic HTML required.
   - Keyboard navigation must work end-to-end.
   - Focus states must be visible.

4. **SEO by construction**
   - Proper heading hierarchy.
   - Descriptive titles and meta.
   - Canonical URLs.
   - Sitemap and robots.txt.

## Content Model (Required)

All dynamic content must come from **content collections**, not hardcoded JSX.

### Journalism
- title
- outlet
- date
- topic/tags
- url or pdf
- short context (1–2 sentences)

### Research
- title
- conference / venue
- year
- role
- methods/tools (E-Prime, etc.)
- artifact (poster PDF or image)

### Achievements
- title
- organization
- year
- category
- evidence (photo or link)

---

## Deployment

The site must be deployable as **pure static output** via:
- Cloudflare Pages
- GitHub Pages

No environment secrets.
No runtime configuration.

---

## What This Architecture Explicitly Rejects

- User accounts
- Dashboards
- Databases
- CMS logins
- Animations that distract from content
- Startup-style growth widgets

This is a **credibility artifact**, not a product.
