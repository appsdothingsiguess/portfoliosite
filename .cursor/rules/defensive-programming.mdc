# Defensive Programming Rules

These rules exist to prevent **false claims, fragile UI, and credibility loss**.

This site represents **real professional work**.  
Failure modes must default to **clarity and safety**, not cleverness.

---

## 1. Truth & Evidence (Highest Priority)

### Absolute Prohibitions

❌ NEVER:
- Invent metrics (numbers, percentages, growth, reach)
- Invent awards, recognitions, or affiliations
- Invent titles, roles, or certifications
- Upgrade responsibility beyond what is provable
- Imply current roles when they are past roles

If a claim cannot be **verified**, it must be **removed**.

---

### Evidence Standard

Every claim must have at least one of:
- A link (article, publication, organization)
- A PDF (poster, resume, document)
- An image (award photo, conference photo)
- A clearly scoped statistic with context

If evidence is missing:
- Downgrade the claim
- Or omit it entirely

---

## 2. Temporal Accuracy

- Past roles → **past tense only**
- Current goals → explicitly framed as “targeting” or “seeking”
- No ambiguous time language (“recently,” “currently”) unless exact

Example:
> ❌ “I am a Research Assistant who programs experiments”  
> ✅ “I worked as a Research Assistant, where I programmed experiments”

---

## 3. Rendering Safety & Fallbacks

The site must **never break** due to missing data.

Pages must render correctly if:
- A content entry is incomplete
- An image fails to load
- A PDF is missing
- A list is empty

### Required Safeguards

- Conditional rendering for optional fields
- Default copy like:
  - “Artifact available upon request”
  - “External link unavailable”
- No uncaught runtime errors

---

## 4. Content Defensive Defaults

When uncertain, default to:

- **Less detail, not more**
- **Neutral framing, not impressive framing**
- **Explicit uncertainty, not implied certainty**

Avoid:
- Superlatives (“elite,” “industry-leading,” “unmatched”)
- Startup language (“scaled aggressively,” “disrupted”)
- Subjective claims without proof

---

## 5. UI & UX Defensiveness

### Attention Defense

Assume:
- Recruiter attention span < 30 seconds
- Mobile or laptop viewing
- No sound

Rules:
- No autoplay media
- No modal traps
- No hidden navigation
- No surprise interactions

---

### Accessibility Defense

- Keyboard navigation must always work
- Focus must always be visible
- Content must be readable without color alone
- Motion must not be required to understand content

---

## 6. Performance Defense

- Prefer static generation over runtime logic
- Avoid JavaScript for non-essential behavior
- Lazy-load images outside the initial viewport
- Avoid large assets unless necessary

Slow or janky pages reduce perceived competence.

---

## 7. Maintainability Defense

- If a change requires edits in more than 2 places, refactor
- Tokens > hardcoded values
- Content > components > pages (priority order)

Avoid:
- Duplicated logic
- One-off hacks
- “Temporary” solutions left in production

---

## 8. Failure Mode Philosophy

When something goes wrong, the system should:
1. Fail quietly
2. Preserve layout
3. Preserve truth
4. Preserve professionalism

Never fail loudly.
Never fail misleadingly.

---

## 9. Final Rule (Override Clause)

When rules conflict:

> **Truth > Accessibility > Clarity > Aesthetics > Cleverness**

This project is a **credibility artifact**, not a demo.

Optimize for trust.
