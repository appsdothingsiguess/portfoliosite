# Coding Standards

These rules are **authoritative**. Cursor must follow them unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

This project is a **static, employer-facing portfolio**, not an app, not a startup, not a playground.

---

## 1. Core Engineering Philosophy

- **Clarity > cleverness**
- **Credibility > aesthetics**
- **Content > components**
- **HTML first, JavaScript last**

If a solution adds complexity without improving employer comprehension, it is wrong.

---

## 2. Technology Constraints (Hard Rules)

- Use **Astro** for all pages and routing.
- Use **TypeScript** for any logic.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for layout and spacing.
- Use **CSS variables (design tokens)** for color and typography.
- Content must come from **Markdown / MDX collections**, not hardcoded JSX.

❌ Do not introduce:
- Client-side state managers
- Animation libraries
- UI frameworks (MUI, Chakra, etc.)
- CMS backends
- Authentication

---

## 3. HTML & Accessibility Standards

### Semantic Structure (Required)

- Every page must have:
  - One `<main>`
  - One `<h1>`
  - Proper heading hierarchy (`h1 → h2 → h3`)
- Navigation must be keyboard accessible.
- A **skip-to-content link** must exist.

### Focus & Interaction

- Never remove focus outlines.
- Use `:focus-visible`, not `:focus`.
- Focus must be visually obvious.

### Images

- Every image requires `alt`.
- Use empty `alt=""` **only** if decorative.
- Always define width and height to avoid layout shift.

---

## 4. JavaScript Rules

JavaScript is **optional**.

Use JS only if:
- HTML + CSS cannot solve the problem
- It improves clarity or accessibility

Rules:
- No inline scripts.
- No global variables.
- No DOM mutation without explanation.
- Prefer build-time logic over runtime logic.

---

## 5. Component Design Rules

### Component Scope

- One component = one responsibility.
- No “mega components.”
- If a component exceeds ~150 lines, split it.

### Naming

- Components: `PascalCase`
- Files: `kebab-case`
- Props: explicit, typed, documented

---

## 6. Styling Rules

### Tailwind Usage

- Tailwind is for:
  - Layout
  - Spacing
  - Typography scale
- **Colors and fonts must come from tokens**, not Tailwind color classes.

Example:
```ts
class="bg-[color:var(--surface)] text-[color:var(--text)]"
````

### Prohibited Styling

❌ No:

* Inline color hex values
* Hardcoded font families
* Over-styled UI effects
* Gradients unless explicitly approved

---

## 7. Content Safety Rules (Critical)

This site represents **real professional work**.

* Do not fabricate:

  * Metrics
  * Awards
  * Dates
  * Titles
  * Certifications
* If information is uncertain, omit it.
* Past roles must be written in **past tense**.

Every claim should be:

* Verifiable
* Linked
* Or supported by an artifact (PDF, image, clip)

---

## 8. Error Handling & Defensive Defaults

Pages must render safely even if:

* A content item is missing
* An image fails to load
* A PDF is unavailable

Rules:

* Provide graceful fallbacks.
* No runtime crashes.
* No broken layouts.

---

## 9. Comments & Documentation

* Comment **why**, not what.
* No commented-out code in committed files.
* If logic exists, explain its necessity.

---

## 10. SEO & Performance

* Titles and meta descriptions are required.
* Avoid blocking JS.
* Lazy-load non-critical images.
* No autoplay media.

---

## 11. What This Project Is NOT

This project is NOT:

* A product demo
* A SaaS landing page
* A design experiment
* A personal playground

It is a **professional credibility artifact** for employers.

When in doubt:

> Optimize for the recruiter who skims for 20 seconds and decides whether to keep reading.

```

---

## What I can do next (recommended)

If you want to fully lock this down, I can:

1. **Rewrite `defensive-programming.mdc` in the same style** (matching tone exactly)
2. Generate **content schema guards** so Cursor *cannot* invent metrics
3. Create a **Cursor master prompt** that explicitly references:
   - architecture.md
   - all-features.md
   - branding-guide.mdc
   - coding-standards.mdc

Just tell me which one to do next.
```
